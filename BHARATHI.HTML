<p>Earth is the third planet from the sun 
and the only astronomical abject know to
harbor life. While large volumes of water
can be found throughout the Solar System,
only Earth sustains liquid surface water.
about 71% of Earth's surface is made up of
the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice,
lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29% of
Earths surface is land, consisting of
continents and islands.</p>

<h1>Food chain</h1>

<font size="5" color="black">
<p>Earth has vast number of living species.
Every living thing, from one-celled algae to giant
blue whale needs food to survive.
The food chain describes who eats whoom in the wild.
Each food chain is a possible pathway that energy and nutrients
can follow through the ecosystem.

<p>A food chain explains which organism
eats another organism in the environment. 
The food chain is a linear sequence of organisms where
nutrients and energy is transferred from one organism to the other.
This occurs when one organism consumes another organism. It begins with
the producer organism, follows the chain and ends with the decomposer 
organism. After understanding the food chain, we realise how one organism
is dependent upon another organism for survival.</p>
